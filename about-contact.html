                    <p>I will cut right to it. I had a great great great grandfather who lived in West Germany and only
                        allowed himself to indulge in the finest of salts that are across this earth. Unfortunately for
                        me, he died in April of 2019 and I was left with his vast collection of exotic salts. I created
                        this website to make the sale of these salts way easier. Please buy as much salt as you want, I
                        donâ€™t want anything to do with them.</p>
                    <p><strong>!SOLD OUT!</strong> <br />An anonymous salt collector bought all of it.</p>
