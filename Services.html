            <h2>Finishing Salt</h2>
            <img src="finishing-salt.jpg" alt="bowl of finishing-salt" class="image-fit">
            <p>Finishing salts are the premier varieties of specialty salts. Harvested
                generally by hand in specific
                regions of the world, finishing salts are most admired for their unique textures—either moist crystals
                or delicate flakes. </p>

            <h2>Coarse Salt</h2>
            <img src="coarse-salt.jpg" alt="coarse-salt" class="image-fit">
            <p>Coarse salt is made up of large-grained salt crystals. Most coarse salts are best used in a grinder,
                providing an easy way of serving up freshly ground sea salt with all of your meals. Coarse salt tends to
                be less moisture sensitive than its finer-grained counterparts, so it resists caking and is easily
                stored. </p>

            <h2>Flake Salt</h2>
            <img src="flake-salt.jpg" alt="flake-salt" class="image-fit">
            <p>Flake sea salt is a light crystal reminiscent of snowflakes. Seawater is evaporated using the natural
                processes of sun and wind, producing salt brine that is fed into an open evaporating pan. The brine is
                then slowly heated until delicate pyramid-shaped crystals of salt are formed.</p>

            <h2>French Sea Salt</h2>
            <img src="french-sea-salt.jpg" alt="french-sea-salt" class="image-fit">
            <p>French sea salts are hand-harvested from pristine Atlantic seawater. These delicious sea salts are
                unrefined so they retain more of the trace minerals that naturally occur in seawater. FRENCH GREY SEA
                SALT, or Sel Gris, is harvested using traditional methods.</p>

            <h2>Hawaiian Sea Salt</h2>
            <img src="black-salt.jpg" alt="black-salt" class="image-fit">
            <p>Alaea sea salt is a traditional Hawaiian table salt used to season and preserve. A natural mineral called
                “Alae” (volcanic, baked red clay) is added to enrich the salt with iron oxide. This natural additive
                gives the salt its distinctive red color.</p>

            <h2>Sea Salt</h2>
            <img src="sea-salt.jpg" alt="sea-salt" class="image-fit">
            <p>Sea salt is a broad term that generally refers to unrefined salt derived directly from a living ocean or
                sea. It is harvested through channeling ocean water into large clay trays and allowing the sun and wind
                to evaporate it naturally. </p>

            <h2>Table Salt</h2>
            <img src="table-salt.jpg" alt="table-salt" class="image-fit">
            <p>Table salt is the most common kind of salt found in the average kitchen. It usually comes from salt
                mines. Once mined, it is refined and most minerals are removed until it is pure sodium chloride. A
                common sentiment is that this process creates a more bland and bitter salt than unprocessed varieties,
                not to mention the removal of the potential benefits of its trace minerals.</p>

            <h2>Italian Sea Salt</h2>
            <img src="Italian-sea-salt.jpg" alt="Italian-sea-salt" class="image-fit">
            <p>Italian sea salt is produced from the low waters of the Mediterranean Sea along the coast of Sicily. Salt
                pans are filled with seawater in the spring and left to evaporate, relying on the heat of the Sicilian
                sun and strong African winds. Harvesting takes place once the water has evaporated, and then the salt is
                crushed and ground without any further refining.</p>
